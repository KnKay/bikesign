a bike lamp with turning and alerting lights

## Electronics
we will have at least 2 domains. One for the bike itself. this will hold the controllers for manual and automated signs.
One for a "trailer" which will only receive the commands. This may be a plugable bike thing without connected inputs?

## Firmware
We should use as much easy stuff as possible. This should result in a plugable thing.

## Hardware

To be discussed. Maybe the module can retrofit existing hardware a bit...
